# Compaction

## Current behavior

Compaction is **reactive and lossy**. After each LLM response, `_maybe_compact_session` checks
`response.usage["total_tokens"]` against 80% of `context_window` (22k default). If exceeded,
`session.compact()` appends a `SummaryEvent` containing the last 20 log entries and sets
`compacted_through` so only the summary + last `memory_window` (50) events are rendered.

Problems:

1. **Reactive only** — the oversized request is already sent before compaction is detected.
   The LLM is charged for tokens it couldn't use effectively.
2. **Crude trigger** — 80% of a static `context_window` doesn't account for variable system
   prompt size, tool definitions, or images.
3. **Single-shot** — compaction runs once. If the summary + recent events still overflow,
   there's no second pass.
4. **Log-store dependency** — the summary is built from `log.jsonl`, which is an unrelated
   append-only interaction log. It contains no conversation semantics.
5. **No structure** — the summary is an opaque text blob. The LLM has no way to ask for
   details about specific turns that were dropped.

## Proposed mechanisms

### 1. LLM-generated summarization

Use a separate (cheaper/smaller) LLM call to summarize the dropped history before discarding it.

```
old events ──► summarize(old events) ──► SummaryEvent
                ▲
                │ second LLM call
```

**Pros:**
- Semantically rich summary that preserves key facts, decisions, and open tasks.
- The summary can be structured (e.g. JSON with fields for "pending tasks", "decisions made",
  "user preferences discovered").
- The summarization model can be different from the main model (cheaper, smaller context).

**Cons:**
- Extra LLM call adds latency (200-800ms) and cost on every compaction.
- Summarization quality varies; important details can be silently dropped.
- Needs a prompt for the summarizer that captures what the main agent needs to remember.
- If compaction is frequent, the summarizer itself may overflow.

### 2. Rolling window with pinned context

Instead of summarizing, maintain a fixed set of "pinned" events that always survive compaction,
plus a rolling tail of recent events.

```
[pinned events] + [recent events: last N]
```

Pinning rules:
- User explicitly pins (e.g. "remember this").
- Agent pins when it detects a commitment ("I'll do X tomorrow").
- High-token events (images, long tool results) are candidates for pinning or eviction.

**Pros:**
- No extra LLM call. Deterministic, fast, free.
- User has explicit control over what survives.
- Pinned events are exact (no lossy summarization).

**Cons:**
- Pinned events consume budget permanently; too many pins → no room for recent context.
- No semantic compression — a 2000-token tool result stays 2000 tokens even if the useful
  information is "the build passed".
- Pin management becomes a UX problem (how does the user unpin?).
- Doesn't handle the common case where the important information is distributed across
  many small turns.

### 3. Hierarchical summarization (summarize-on-compact, retain tiers)

On compaction, don't throw away everything. Instead, tier the history:

```
Tier 0: pinned events (always kept verbatim)
Tier 1: summary of older window (LLM-generated)
Tier 2: recent N events (verbatim)
```

On each compaction, the previous Tier 1 summary is folded into the new summary along with
the events being dropped, so context degrades gracefully rather than vanishing.

```
before:  [Tier0] + [Tier1 old_summary] + [last 50 events]
compact: [Tier0] + [Tier1 new_summary(old_summary + dropped)] + [last 50 events]
```

**Pros:**
- Best of (1) and (2): semantic summaries + pinned verbatim context.
- Graceful degradation — information is compressed, not deleted.
- Summarization cost is bounded because it only runs at compaction boundaries.

**Cons:**
- Most complex to implement. Needs tier management, fold-in logic, and careful prompt design.
- Summary-of-summary can drift or hallucinate over multiple compactions.
- More state to persist and render correctly.
- Debugging is harder: which turn ended up in the summary vs. verbatim?

### 4. Pre-call proactive compaction

Estimate token count *before* sending to the LLM and compact preemptively if needed.

```
estimate(messages) > budget * 0.7  →  compact  →  re-estimate  →  send
```

Estimation methods:
- **Character heuristic** (already removed): `len(json) // 4`. Fast but ±30% inaccurate.
- **tiktoken / model tokenizer**: exact for the specific model, but adds a dependency and
  ~5ms per call.
- **Provider-side**: some providers return `prompt_tokens` in streaming mode before the full
  response. Not universally available.

**Pros:**
- Prevents wasted tokens on oversized requests.
- Composable with any of the above compaction strategies.
- Cheap if using the character heuristic.

**Cons:**
- Heuristic estimates can be wrong, causing either premature compaction (wasted context)
  or late compaction (wasted tokens).
- Adds a render-estimate-compact-render cycle before every call.
- The correct budget is `context_window - max_tokens` (output reserve), not `context_window`.

### 5. Sliding context with tool-result truncation

Instead of dropping whole events, selectively truncate large inline content:

- Tool results over N tokens get truncated to a summary + "call read_file to see full output".
- Image references stay as stubs (`[image: path]`) rather than base64 inline.
- Assistant reasoning content is trimmed aggressively (already done: `_MAX_REASONING_CHARS = 500`).

**Pros:**
- Preserves conversational structure (every turn is still visible).
- Targeted: only the expensive parts are cut, not entire turns.
- No LLM call needed for the truncation itself.

**Cons:**
- Tool result truncation can break multi-step tool chains (agent calls tool A, then needs
  tool A's full output for tool B).
- Doesn't help when the overflow is caused by many small messages, not a few large ones.
- The agent needs re-prompting or re-calling tools to recover truncated data, wasting tokens.

## Recommendation

**Phase 1** (immediate, no new dependencies):
- Implement **(4) pre-call estimation** using the character heuristic, re-added cleanly.
- Fix the budget to `context_window - max_tokens` to reserve output space.
- Combine with **(5) tool-result truncation** for results over a configurable threshold.

**Phase 2** (when compaction becomes a real pain point):
- Implement **(1) LLM-generated summarization** as the compaction strategy, replacing the
  current log-store approach.
- Use the same model with a dedicated summarization prompt, or a cheaper model.
- Store the summary as structured JSON (not free text) so future compactions can fold in.

**Phase 3** (if sessions grow very long-lived):
- Add **(2) pinned events** on top of (1), giving users explicit control.
- The pinned set is a session-level concept, not per-compaction.

## Config additions

```yaml
agents:
  master:
    context_window: 22000
    max_tokens: 8192
    memory_window: 50
    compaction:
      threshold: 0.7          # fraction of (context_window - max_tokens)
      max_tool_result_tokens: 2000  # truncate tool results above this
      summarize: false        # Phase 2: use LLM summarization
      summarize_model: null   # Phase 2: model for summarization (default: same model)
```
